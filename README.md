# telegram-mumble-bot
TelegramMumbleBot is a simple telegram bot to notify mumble events to telegram chats.
It can be easily deployed to Heroku, it just needs some config vars to be defined on your heroku app. It was originally written by yagop and is, in this fork, modified for use with the pp-mumble server.
